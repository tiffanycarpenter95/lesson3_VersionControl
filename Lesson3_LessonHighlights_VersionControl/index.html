            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions of the file later. Instead of simply changing the file over and over and only recording each newest version, a version control system saves each change as a snapshot, so you can refer back to each “version” later. This means that multiple people can work on files at the same time and push them to a remote repository, and no files get overwritten. In fact, once each developer has made their changes and pushed them to the remote repository, each version can be merged to make a final product. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">“Git” is described as a free, widely-used source code management system for software development, used for version control. It built for speed and data integrity.
There is a whole slew of git commands used to control your work flow. The most basic being git add, which puts your current version of a file into a staging area. Next would be git commit, which take the file from the staging area and “commits” it to your local repository. The last step is to type git push, which pushes the file finally to a remote repository to be stored. Using git, you can push files to remote repositories and also pull files that have been changed.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In reference to version control systems, a repository is defined as either a local or remote location to store data, and more specifically for VCSs, versions of changed files that can be pulled and pushed by individual users at any time.  Every individual user has a local repository on their computer, where files first go after they are staged. Multiple users are able to access a remote repository, which is where files are pushed from the local repository.  On a system like GitHub, users can create as many different repositories as they want to store different projects, and this technology can be used by one lone developer or even a massive corporation.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed vs Centralized</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are a few different types of version control systems: Centralized Version Control Systems and Distributed Version Control Systems.  The advantage to this system is that everyone knows pretty much all the time what everyone else on the project is working on. The person in charge has control on what each developer is doing and is allowed to do. This system is housed on a single server- and therein lies the rub. If the server goes down, productivity is also crushed, because NO ONE can work on any files in the repository in that case. This problem is solved with Distributed VCSs. Every version of every file is cloned and not housed only on one server, so if the server does go out, the repositories can be copied back up somewhere else. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While it's great to use a version control system and create workspaces with something like Cloud9, and it's great to use a Git system like GitHub, the two technologies are quite lonely by themselves. To use, they must be configured together. The SSH key from Cloud9 must be inserted and applied on GitHub, and Cloud9 must be linked to Github. The last step is to actually creat a repository on GitHub, because those filed have to have to go somewhere! As stated in previous sections, you can create as many repositories necessary on GitHub, and you can even merge the changes in some repositories together using git merge. </p>
